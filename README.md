# Optimization Algorithms GUI â€” MATLAB

This was made using MATLAB R2016a

It can be built into an *.exe file but will still require MatLab to be installed in the computer running the file.

There are 5 example mathematic functions to be optimized named f1, f2, f3, f4, and f5.

In the text insertion method of adding functions to be optimized you can use MatLab functions such as sin() exp() pow() or functions available in the path.

The GUI only plots functions with either 1 or 2 variables but can optimize and return the optimal points of functions with a higher number of variables.

The results of 2 examples can be seen in the following images:

</div>

> this is an old code so it has most of its functionality written in portuguese.
